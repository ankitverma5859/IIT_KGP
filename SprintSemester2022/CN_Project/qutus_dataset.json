You've got workers who are deciding to cut an entire day and entire day's worth of pay so that their fellow co-workers aren't laid off. I think that across the board people are making adjustments, large and small, to accommodate the fact that we're in very difficult times right now.Indeed, Obama's assessment of Americans' sacrifice was emphasized later in the press conference when Ebony magazine's Kevin Chappell asked about a recent report, which found that as a result of the economic downturn, one in 50 children are now homeless in America.Part of the change in attitudes that I want to see here in Washington and all across the country is a belief that it is not acceptable for children and families to be without a roof over their heads in a country as wealthy as ours, replied Obama, pledging to initiate a range of programs as well to deal with homelessness",

The president brokered the New World Collectivism even signing on to a communique that Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz said repudiated the previous U.S. led push to free capitalism from the constraints of government.  This is a major step forward and a reversal of the ideology of the 1990s, and at a very official level, a rejection of the ideas pushed by the U.S. and others, it's a historic moment when the world came together and said we were wrong to push deregulation, said Stiglitz.",
